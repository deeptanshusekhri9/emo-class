NLP Coursework Individual submission: Deeptanshu Sekhri

The 4 experiments are split into 2 different iPython notebooks. 
They are expected to work independently although with some code overlap.

Although this is not desirable, but we had to do it due to their size and heavy JavaScript visualisations(which can overload the system its being run upon).

The code is split as below:

Experiment 1&2: go_emo_exp_1_2.ipynb
Experiment 3&4: go_emo_exp_3_4.ipynb


Please install the required python libraries from requirements.txt(pip using conda recommended)
